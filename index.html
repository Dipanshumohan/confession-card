        <p>It's not been too long since we met.. so Misha I want us to learn about each other together.. together as
            lovers.. But I know one thing for sure.. that I really reallyyy loveeeee you and you are the one who made me
            want to love someone else again... and I want you to be the only one I wanna ever love.</p>
        <p>This past month after meeting you seems like a dream to me..My mornings start with your messages and my night
            ends with you in my thoughts and good dreams which you wish me :3 ... </p>
        <p> I never want this dream to ever end.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="paper seventh-block">
        <p>Our first meeting was us sharing our previous love failures.. But Misha... you know I am glad.. that because
            of our those experiences.. I got to meet you.</p>
        <p>The only thing I hate is not being with you when you were lonely and needed someone... I am so glad that you
            pushed through all those feelings you had at that time... Thank you Misha.. for being alive.. otherwise I'd
            have never got to meet you.</p>
        <p>And I wanna make sure.. that you never feel that way ever again..I wanna be your emotional support..someone
            you can lean on..and someone you can love.</p>

            your photo and yeah those eyes... they make my heartbeat go faster. I love you for that</p>
        <p> Babe.. If I start mentioning everything about you this website is gonna crash xD as this site is not enough
            to express everything I like about you.. I'd rather telling you directly ehe~</p>
        <p>I love everything about my Misha. I might have not seen you irl.. but seeing you in my notifications has
            always put a smile on my face. I started to wake up early just so that I can talk to you..</p>
